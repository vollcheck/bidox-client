* On Static Generation vs. Server-side Rendering

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page ahead of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is not a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

However, for some pages, you might not be able to render the HTML without first fetching some external data. Maybe you need to access the file system, fetch external API, or query your database at build time. Next.js supports this case — Static Generation with data — out of the box.
